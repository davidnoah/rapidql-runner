## What is RapidQL?

RapidQL is an open source unified interface for querying datasources like databases and online APIs. RapidQL letâ€™s you join multiple datasources together, to combine and enrich data. You can find more information at http://www.rapidql.com/ or the GitHub repo https://github.com/iddogino/rapidql.

Documentation: https://docs.rapidql.com/

## Getting Started

This repo houses the most current version of rapidql-runner; a package to perform RapidQL querys directly in the Atom text editor.

Install the package using `apm install rapidql-runner`

In your current directory, create two files

- .rqloptions
- .rqlcontext

The options file contains all of your database and API connection info. You can find out more about these files by heading over to https://docs.rapidql.com/.

Example .rqloptions file
  ```
  {
  "RapidAPI": {
    "projectName": "rapidql-demo_5933abb8e4b05d38a42ea98b",
    "apiKey": "################"
  },
  "MySQL": {
    "Demo":{
      "host": "###########",
      "user": "########",
      "password": "########",
      "database": "public",
      "port": "3306"
    }
  }
}
```

The context file contains any variables/API keys you will need in your query.

Example .rqlcontext file
```
{
  "mailboxLayerAPIKey": "###############"
}
```

Now that you have created two files to house both your options and context object, you can now create an RQL query. Create a new file with the extension `.rql`. Again, you can read about writing RapidQL queries here: https://docs.rapidql.com/.

Example query

```
{
    MySQL.Demo.users.find() {
        email,
        RapidAPI.Mailboxlayer.checkEmail(email: email, apiKey: mailboxLayerAPIKey) {
            score
        }
    }
}
```

If your current directory contains these files, select the query file in your Atom file tree and run the query!

## Running your .rql query

In order to run the rapidql-runner, press the hotkey `CTRL-ALT-O` once a query is selected. This will cause a user interface to appear which will contains a response or any errors associated with the query.
